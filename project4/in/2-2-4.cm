/*
In an array declaration, the index must be greater than zero.
For variable or array initializations, the type of the left-hand side must be the same as that of the
right-hand (after performing type coercion).

For array initializations, the number of initializers should be equal to or less than the array size.

If there are fewer initializers than elements in the array, the remaining elements are automatically
initialized to 0. For example,

void foo(){
    int a = 3.1; // no
    const int b = 3.1; // no
    double c = 3.1;
    const double d = 3.1;
    const bool e = true, f = false, q = 6; // no
}
